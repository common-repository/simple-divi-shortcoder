Create Sections and Modules in the Divi library and then insert them anywhere using the shortcode [showmodule id="246"] where the ID is the ID of the section/module in the library.

== Description ==
The purpose of this plugin is to allow you to embed Divi sections or modules within other Divi modules or anything else that supports shortcodes.

The process is quite simple. All you need to do is create or save a section or module to the Divi Library and then embed it using the shortcode [showmodule id="246"] where the ID is the ID of the section/module in the library. You can find the ID by navigating to the layout editor and in the URL you'll see the ID there. For example, in this URL, the ID is 777: https://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=777&action=edit. You can also find the ID by hovering over the word Edit in the layout page, you'll see the ID in the link displayed at the bottom of the screen.

Simple Divi Shortcoder is based on the tutorial by Fabrice (creaweb2b.com) called How to add a DIVI section or module inside another module (https://www.creaweb2b.com/en/how-to-add-a-divi-section-or-module-inside-another-module/).

== Installation ==
Install the plugin like you would any other plugin, directly from your plugins page but looking it up in the WordPress.org repository, or manually upload it to your server to the /wp-content/plugins/ folder.
